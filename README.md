# data enrichment week 15 core assignment 2 - Hypothesis Testing with Insurance Data (Core)

For this assignment, we will be working with the [US Health Insurance Dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQBN8DPW2rdiRrY34eEM53HAzakNGSRrw4ogI-j8HyCUrbqTB_z4CeIn2IvjLF-w_6sOe5pIlypJGAA/pub?output=csv) from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/teertha/ushealthinsurancedataset).

We have been asked to use our hypothesis testing skills to answer the following questions:

- Q1. Do smokers have higher insurance charges than non-smokers?
- Q2. Are men more likely to smoke than women?
- Q3. Do different regions have different charges, on average?



For each question, make sure to:

1. State your Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis
2. Select the correct test according to the data type and number of samples
3. Test the assumptions of your selected test.
4. Execute the selected test, or the alternative test (if you do not meet the assumptions)
5. Interpret your p-value and reject or fail to reject your null hypothesis 
6. Show a supporting visualization that helps display the result
